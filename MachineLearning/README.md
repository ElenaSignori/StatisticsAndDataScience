# Machine Learning
This folder contains the exam project carried out with another student. 
We chose a data set about the bike sharing service in Seoul, you can find it here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand.

In this folder there are several other folders which contains:
• DATA: contains all the different data set versions created: the original dataset, the training set, the validation set, the test set and all the dummy versions./n
• MODELS: contains all the estimated models and also grid-search and cross-validation results./n
• UTILS: contains some useful codes./n

There are also some files:
• bike_sharing_seoul_v4.Rproj: Rstudio project file.
• EDA_nb.Rmd: notebook with exploratory data analysis.
• EDA_nb.pdf: same notebook as above in pdf format.
• modeling_nb.Rmd: notebook containing scripts and summary of some models.
• modeling_nb.pdf: same notebook as above in pdf format.
• bike_GBM_nb.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file with Gradient Boosting Machine esteems.
• bike_SVR_nb.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file with Support Vector Machine esteems.
• bike_MLP_nb.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file with Multilayer Peceptron esteems.
